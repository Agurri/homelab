Homelab Server Build and Install Notes

I built a basic home server base on FreeNAS a few years ago and never documented what I was doing or the problems I encountered. I spent far too much time searching for the same problems every now and then. Sometimes, I would find my own answer on a forum for the problem I had.

Now, I'm building a new Proxmox server to move all the services from the TrueNAS box to this new one. And I want to document it. Try to.
